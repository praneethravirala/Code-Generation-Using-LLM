# Code-Generation-Using-LLM
This project enhances SQL query generation from natural language using LLMs, optimizing with Hierarchical Decomposition for modularity and consistency. It leverages T5 for text-to-SQL, evaluates performance using Fuzz Ratio, BLEU, and ROUGE, and ensures accuracy through rigorous testing and validation.
